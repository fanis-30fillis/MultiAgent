# MultiAgent
This is a Java project that i did as a university project for the a course
on Multi Agent Systems.

It is a simple enviroment where three taxi agents deliver clients to their
destination.

The cooperation and the distribution of clients to the agents is done via
an auction where the agents send their position and the number of clients
they have in their queue and the enviroment decides who gets the client
or who proceeds to the next tile if there's conflict between the agents.
